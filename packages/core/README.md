# TaskManagerApp

`make-traffic-integration-core` is a task management library designed for traffic exchange systems. 
It provides an interface to handle campaigns, process tasks, and manage event subscriptions. A single instance should be created globally.
Check [Github repository](https://github.com/koltsov-iv/make-traffic-integration-lib) for more examples.

## Installation
```sh
npm install make-traffic-integration-core
```

## Usage
```typescript
import {TaskManagerApp} from "make-traffic-integration-core";


const config = {
    apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
    appKey: 'your-app-key'
};

const taskManager = TaskManagerApp(config);

await taskManager.init();
```

Processes the specified campaign task.

### `async claimProcess(userID: string, task: Campaign): Promise<void>`

### `subscribe(event: Events, callback: (task: Campaign) => void): void`

### `unsubscribe(event: Events, callback: (task: Campaign) => void): void`

## Events

### `Events.CampaignClaimSucceed`

```typescript
const onCampaignClaimed = (task: Campaign) => {
    console.log('Campaign claimed:', task);
};

taskManager.subscribe(Events.CampaignClaimSucceed, onCampaignClaimed);

taskManager.getCampaigns('user123').then(campaigns => {
    if (campaigns.length > 0) {
        taskManager.claimProcess('user123', campaigns[0]);
    }
